# bayesian_ssbm_rank
Bayesian modelling to assess the skill levels and ranks of ssbm players using head to head records as data.

The data comes from [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WoYCkDNrlA32F9NDdPGMtozNdL8K5u9MRnrvreYUymg/edit#gid=1392647634), which I stumbled upon on reddit. I don't know who gathered this data, but thank you.
